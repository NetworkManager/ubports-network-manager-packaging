Description: network management framework (daemon and userspace tools)
 NetworkManager is a system network service that manages your network devices
 and connections, attempting to keep active network connectivity when
 available. It manages ethernet, WiFi, mobile broadband (WWAN), and PPPoE
 devices, and provides VPN integration with a variety of different VPN
 services.
 .
 This package provides the userspace daemons and a command line interface to
 interact with NetworkManager.
 .
 Optional dependencies:
  * ppp: Required for establishing dial-up connections (e.g. via GSM).
  * dnsmasq-base/iptables: Required for creating Ad-hoc connections and
    connection sharing.
    address configuration.
  * libteam-utils: Network Team driver allows multiple network interfaces to be
    teamed together and act like a single one. This process is called "ethernet
    bonding", "channel teaming" or "link aggregation".

Description: NetworkManager configuration to enable connectivity checking
 This package contains a configuration file which enables NetworkManager's
 connectivity checking functionality.
 .
 NetworkManager will try to connect to a Debian server to determine the
 connection status.
 .
 This is particularly useful for captive portal detection.
 .
 No user data is transmitted in the connectivity checks, but merely contacting
 the Debian connectivity check servers reveals that the user is running a
 Debian(-based) operating system with NetworkManager.
